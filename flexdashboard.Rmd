### Chart A

## Column {data-width=650}

How many series total?

```{r}
challenges %>% 
  distinct(series) 
```

## Column {data-width=350}

How many episodes in each series?

```{r}
epi_by_series <- challenges %>% 
  count(series, episode) %>% 
  count(series)
epi_by_series
```
### Chart B

ggplot(epi_by_series, aes(as.factor(series), nn)) +
  geom_col()
```

### Chart C

How many bakers in each series?

```{r}
bakers %>% 
  count(series)

bakers %>% 
  group_by(series) %>%
